# Supabase Setup Guide for Bible Study Hub

## Why Supabase is Perfect for Your Project

✅ **Better than Neon**: Built-in auth, real-time updates, file storage  
✅ **Free Tier**: More generous than most alternatives  
✅ **School Friendly**: Easy dashboard for demonstration  
✅ **Modern**: Real-time features impress teachers  

## Step 1: Create Supabase Project (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Sign in with your existing account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `bible-study-hub`
   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (save it!)
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your location
5. Click "Create new project"
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for setup to complete

## Step 2: Get Connection Details

1. In your Supabase dashboard, click "Settings" (gear icon)
2. Go to "Database" section
3. Scroll down to "Connection string"
4. Copy the **"Connection pooling"** URI (not the direct connection)
5. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual database password

Your connection string looks like:
```
postgresql://postgres.xxxxx:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

## Step 3: Update Your Project

I'll help you configure the project to use Supabase instead of Neon.

## Step 4: Initialize Database Schema

Once connected, we'll run:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

This creates all the tables your Bible Study Hub needs.
