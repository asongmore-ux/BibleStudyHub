## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

✅ Project is working locally  
✅ Database schema ready (Neon PostgreSQL)  
✅ Vercel configuration files created  
✅ Admin setup functionality added  
✅ Environment variables prepared  

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)

### A. Create Neon Database
1. Visit https://neon.tech
2. Sign up with your school email
3. Click "Create Project"
4. Name it: `bible-study-hub`
5. Copy the connection string (looks like: `postgresql://username:password@...`)

### B. Initialize Database
In your Replit project, run:
```bash
npm run db:push
```
This creates all the necessary tables.

---

## 🌍 Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (10 minutes)

### A. Push to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Name it: `bible-study-hub`
3. In Replit, run these commands:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Bible Study Hub"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/bible-study-hub.git
git push -u origin main
```

### B. Connect to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select your `bible-study-hub` repository
5. Click "Import"

### C. Configure Build Settings
Vercel should auto-detect these settings:
- **Build Command**: `vite build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

If not auto-detected, set them manually.

## 🔐 Step 3: Environment Variables

In your Vercel project dashboard:

1. Go to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
2. Add these variables:

| Variable | Value | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your Neon connection string | `postgresql://user:pass@host/db` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Random 32+ character string | `your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-long` |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | `production` |

**Generate Session Secret**: Use https://generate-secret.vercel.app/ or create a random string

## 🎛️ Step 4: Deploy and Test

1. Click "Deploy" in Vercel
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete
3. Visit your live URL: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## 👑 Step 5: Create First Admin

### Method 1: Admin Setup Page (Recommended)
1. Visit: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app/admin-setup`
2. Enter your school email and full name
3. Click "Create Admin Account"
4. You're now the admin!

### Method 2: Database Direct (Advanced)
